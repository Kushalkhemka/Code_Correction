  "fix_result": "BUG FIX COMPLETE:\n- Bug Classification: Incorrect assignment operator\n- Original Bug: The assignment assumes that starting the approximation at half of x will yield a good estimate for the square root.\n- Fix Applied: Changed the initial approximation to `approx = x` to ensure a better starting point for the iterative calculation.\n- Reasoning: Starting the approximation at `x` provides a more accurate estimate for the square root, particularly improving convergence for values of `x` less than 1.\n\nThe fixed code has been written to the file with the proper classification header.",
