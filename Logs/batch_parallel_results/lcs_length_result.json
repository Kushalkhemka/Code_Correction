It should also consider cases when `i` or `j` are out of bounds (particularly at their starting values). Since there's an attempt to access `dp[i - 1, j]`, it could lead to a KeyError when i=0.\",\n    \"fix_suggestion\": \"Modify the line to handle initial cases correctly. Introduce a condition that checks if i is 0 to avoid going out of bounds. For example: `dp[i, j] = dp[i - 1, j] + 1 if i > 0 else 1`.\"\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Bug:\n- The issue is with the attempt to access `dp[i - 1, j]` when `i` is `0`. This will raise a KeyError since `Counter` will not have a key for negative indices. The intent is to build upon previously computed substrings, but when starting, a direct assignment is needed instead. \n\n### Suggested Fix:\nTo address this, we can modify the assignment to include checks:\n```python\ndp[i, j] = dp[i - 1, j] + 1 if i > 0 else 1\n``` \n\nThis way, when `i` is `0`, the length of the longest common substring that ends at `j` in `t` begins at `1` instead of trying to access the previous index.",
  "fix_result": "BUG FIX COMPLETE:\n- **Bug Classification:** Missing arithmetic expression\n- **Original Bug:** The line attempts to compute the value for the longest common substring but doesn't initialize `dp[i, j]` properly, leading to potential KeyErrors when accessing `dp[i - 1, j]` with `i` equal to `0`.\n- **Fix Applied:** The line was modified to include a condition that checks if `i` is greater than `0`, allowing safe initialization of `dp[i, j]`.\n- **Reasoning:** By modifying the assignment to `dp[i, j] = dp[i - 1, j] + 1 if i > 0 else 1`, we ensure that when `i` is `0`, it correctly initializes the length of the longest common substring without trying to access an undefined index.\n\nThe fixed code has been written to the file with proper classification header.",
