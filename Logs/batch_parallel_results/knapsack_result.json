If 'weight' is exactly equal to 'j', it should still allow for the item to be included in the knapsack. The current line will skip valid items that can fit exactly into the remaining capacity.\",\n    \"fix_suggestion\": \"Change the line to 'if weight <= j:'.\"\n}\n``` \n\n### Explanation\n- **Bug:** The line `if weight < j:` incorrectly checks whether the weight of the current item is less than the current capacity. This will exclude items that can precisely fit into the remaining capacity of the knapsack.\n- **Fix:** The line should be modified to `if weight <= j:` to include items that exactly match the current capacity.",
  "fix_result": "BUG FIX COMPLETE:\n- Bug Classification: Incorrect comparison operator\n- Original Bug: The comparison operator used is incorrect because it should check if the weight is less than or equal to the capacity.\n- Fix Applied: Changed the line from `if weight < j:` to `if weight <= j:`.\n- Reasoning: This fix allows the knapsack to include items that fit exactly into the remaining capacity, ensuring that valid items are not skipped.\n\nThe fixed code has been written to the file with the proper classification header.",
