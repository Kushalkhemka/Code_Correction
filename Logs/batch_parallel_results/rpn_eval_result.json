  "fix_result": "BUG FIX COMPLETE:\n- **Bug Classification:** Missing condition\n- **Original Bug:** The function fails to handle scenarios where there are not enough operands in the stack.\n- **Fix Applied:** Added a condition to check if the stack has at least two items before attempting to pop them. If not, a `ValueError` is raised.\n- **Reasoning:** This fix prevents an `IndexError` by ensuring that there are enough operands in the stack, effectively handling cases where an operation cannot be performed due to insufficient values.\n\nThe fixed code has been written to the file with the proper classification header.",
