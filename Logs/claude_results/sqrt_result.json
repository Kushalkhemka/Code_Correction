The algorithm should check how close the square of the approximation is to the input value x, or alternatively how much the approximation changes between iterations.\",\n    \"fix_suggestion\": \"Change the condition to 'while abs(approx * approx - x) > epsilon:' to check how close the square of our approximation is to the original value x.\"\n}\n```\n\nThe Newton-Raphson method for calculating square roots should check how close the square of the approximation is to the original number, or how much the approximation changes between iterations. The current implementation incorrectly compares the approximation directly to the input value, which doesn't properly test for convergence to the square root value.",
  "fix_result": "BUG FIX COMPLETE (Claude 3.7 Sonnet):\n- Bug Classification: Incorrect comparison operator\n- Original Bug: The loop condition was using `abs(x - approx) > epsilon`, which compares the approximation directly to the input value instead of checking convergence correctly.\n- Fix Applied: Changed the condition to `abs(approx * approx - x) > epsilon` to properly check how close the square of our approximation is to the original value.\n- Reasoning: In the Newton-Raphson method for square root calculation, we need to check if our approximation is accurate by seeing how close its square is to the original number. The original code was incorrectly measuring the difference between the approximation and the input value directly, which doesn't test for convergence to the square root value. The new condition properly tests whether our approximation, when squared, is within epsilon of the target value x, which is the correct termination criterion for this algorithm.\n\nThe fixed code has been written to the file with proper classification header.",
