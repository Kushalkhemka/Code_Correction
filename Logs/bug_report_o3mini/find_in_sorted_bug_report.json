    "buggy_line": "return binsearch(mid, end)",
    "bug_type": "Recursion boundary error",
    "explanation": "When x > arr[mid], the recursive call uses the same mid index (i.e., binsearch(mid, end)) instead of excluding it. This may cause an infinite loop or repeatedly check the same element, especially when start+1 equals end. The correct behavior is to start the search from the next index (mid+1).",
    "fix_suggestion": "Change the line to: return binsearch(mid + 1, end)"
