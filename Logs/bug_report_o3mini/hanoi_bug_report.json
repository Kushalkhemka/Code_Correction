    "algorithm_purpose": "This algorithm is meant to solve the Towers of Hanoi puzzle by recursively determining the steps needed to move a stack of disks from the start peg to the end peg, using the third peg as a helper. For a given height (number of disks), it moves height-1 disks from the start to the helper peg, then moves the largest disk from start to end, and finally moves the height-1 disks from the helper peg to the end.",
    "code_walkthrough": "The function hanoi is defined to take a 'height' and peg numbers for 'start' and 'end'. It initializes an empty list 'steps'. For every case where height > 0, it computes the helper peg by taking the set {1, 2, 3} and removing the start and end pegs, then using pop() to retrieve the third peg. It then recursively computes the moves for height-1 disks from 'start' to 'helper', appends the move of a disk from 'start' to 'helper' (which is intended to be the move of the largest disk), and finally recursively computes the moves for height-1 disks from 'helper' to 'end'. The expected algorithm for Towers of Hanoi should, however, on the base case (height == 1), directly return a move from 'start' to 'end'.",

Specifically, if height == 1, return [(start, end)] instead of performing the recursive calls that compute a helper peg and move the disk there.
