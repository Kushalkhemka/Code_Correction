    "bug_type": "incorrect return value for prime numbers",
    "explanation": "When n is prime (such as 101), the loop never finds a factor and the function incorrectly returns an empty list. Instead, it should return [n] as per the expected prime factorization output.",
    "fix_suggestion": "Replace the final 'return []' with 'return [n]' so that the function returns the prime number itself when no factors are found."
