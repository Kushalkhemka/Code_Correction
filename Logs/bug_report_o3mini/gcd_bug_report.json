    "bug_type": "incorrect argument ordering",
    "explanation": "The Euclidean algorithm requires you to call gcd with the second argument and the remainder of the division of the first argument by the second (i.e., gcd(b, a % b)). By calling gcd(a % b, b), the function ends up computing the wrong values and will either not terminate correctly or produce incorrect results.",
    "fix_suggestion": "Change the recursive call to: return gcd(b, a % b)"
