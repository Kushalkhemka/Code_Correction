    "code_walkthrough": "The function 'flatten' iterates over each element 'x' in the input 'arr'. If 'x' is a list, it recursively calls 'flatten(x)' and yields each value 'y' from that recursive call. If 'x' is not a list, it directly yields flatten(x). However, this is where the bug lies: instead of yielding the element 'x' itself when it is not a list, the function incorrectly calls 'flatten(x)' even though 'x' is a non-list. This call is inappropriate because 'flatten' expects a list iteration and will likely lead to an error if 'x' is not iterable.",
