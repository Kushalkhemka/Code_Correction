    "explanation": "The function only checks if the depth ever goes negative, which catches cases where there are extra closing parentheses. However, it fails to verify that the number of opening parentheses matches the number of closing ones. If there are extra opening parentheses (i.e., depth > 0) at the end, the function incorrectly returns True.",
    "fix_suggestion": "Change the final return statement to return whether depth is 0. For example, replace line 11 with: 'return depth == 0'."
