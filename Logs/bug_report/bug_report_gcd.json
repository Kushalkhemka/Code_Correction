  "bug_type": "Logic Error (incorrect argument order)",
  "explanation": "The Euclidean algorithm must recurse on gcd(b, a % b), not gcd(a % b, b).  When a < b, a % b == a, so calling gcd(a % b, b) never makes progress and leads to infinite recursion.",
  "fix_suggestion": "Change the recursive call to `return gcd(b, a % b)`."
