  "line_number": 11,

  "bug_type": "LogicError",
  "explanation": "The function never verifies that all opening parentheses have been closed. As written, it only rejects strings with too many closing parentheses but will accept strings with unmatched '(' (e.g. \"(()\" returns True).",
  "fix_suggestion": "Replace `return True` with `return depth == 0` so that the function only returns True when the nesting depth ends exactly at zero."
