{"line_number": 9, "buggy_line": "return binsearch(mid, end)", "bug_type": "off-by-one / infinite recursion", "explanation": "When x > arr[mid], the code recurses with the same mid as the new start, so the search interval doesn’t shrink and you get infinite recursion (or incorrect behavior).", "fix_suggestion": "Change it to `return binsearch(mid + 1, end)` so the right half search excludes the already-checked mid index."}
