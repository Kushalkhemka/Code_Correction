{"line_number": 16, "buggy_line": "    # missing here: opstack.append(token)", "bug_type": "Logic error (missing operation)", "explanation": "After you pop all operators of higher or equal precedence off the stack, you never push the current operator (`token`) onto `opstack`. This means no operators ever get stacked and the output RPN is incorrect.", "fix_suggestion": "Immediately after the `while` that pops from `opstack`, add:\n\n    opstack.append(token)\n\nso that each operator is eventually pushed onto the stack."}
