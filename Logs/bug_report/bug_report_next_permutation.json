  "explanation": "To find the next lexicographic permutation, you must swap perm[i] with the smallest element strictly greater than it to its right. The code’s condition perm[j] < perm[i] picks smaller elements instead of larger ones.",
  "fix_suggestion": "Change the comparison operator to '>' so that it reads: if perm[j] > perm[i]:"
