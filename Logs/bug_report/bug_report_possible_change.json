{"line_number":8,"buggy_line":"first, *rest = coins","bug_type":"MissingBaseCase / UnpackingError","explanation":"If `coins` is empty, unpacking into `first` and `rest` raises a ValueError. The function doesn’t handle the base case of an empty coin list, so it crashes instead of returning 0 ways.","fix_suggestion":"Before unpacking, add a check for an empty list: `if not coins: return 0`. This ensures you return 0 when there are no coins left."}
