--- PHASE 1: Simple Analysis (Fast Track) ---
Running simple bug finder...
Bug Analysis Result:
{
  "line_number": 5,
  "buggy_line": "        if hare.successor is None:",
  "bug_type": "missing null check",
  "explanation": "The code only checks if hare.successor is None, but does not check if hare itself is None before attempting to access hare.successor.successor. This could lead to an AttributeError if hare becomes None. In the tortoise-and-hare algorithm, both hare and hare.successor should be checked to ensure they are not None before accessing hare.successor.successor.",
  "fix_suggestion": "Modify the condition to check if hare is None or hare.successor is None, e.g.:\n        if hare is None or hare.successor is None:\n            return False"
}

Fix Result:
BUG FIX:
- Original Bug: The code only checks if hare.successor is None, but fails to check if hare itself is None before dereferencing it.
- Fix Applied: Modified the condition to "if hare is None or hare.successor is None:" to ensure that both hare and hare.successor are not None before accessing hare.successor.successor.
- Reasoning: By adding a check for whether hare is None, we prevent an AttributeError that would occur when trying to access successor on a NoneType object. This change guarantees safe access of hare's successor attribute and correctly implements the tortoise-and-hare algorithm for cycle detection.
