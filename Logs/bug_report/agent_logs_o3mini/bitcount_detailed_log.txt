--- PHASE 1: Simple Analysis (Fast Track) ---
Running simple bug finder...
Bug Analysis Result:
{
    "line_number": 4,
    "buggy_line": "        n ^= n - 1",
    "bug_type": "incorrect operator",
    "explanation": "The algorithm is intended to use Brian Kernighan's method to clear the lowest set bit by performing a bitwise AND with (n - 1). However, the code uses the XOR operator (^=) instead of the AND operator (&=). This results in incorrect behavior and can lead to an infinite loop since n is not reduced as expected.",
    "fix_suggestion": "Replace the XOR operator with the AND operator so that the line reads: 'n &= n - 1'"
}

Running simple bug fixer...
Fix Result:
BUG FIX:
- Original Bug: Used the XOR operator (n ^= n - 1) instead of the intended bitwise AND operator to clear the lowest set bit.
- Fix Applied: Replaced "n ^= n - 1" with "n &= n - 1".
- Reasoning: Brian Kernighan's algorithm should use a bitwise AND with (n - 1) to remove the lowest set bit, thereby ensuring the algorithm proceeds correctly. Using the XOR operator does not necessarily clear the lowest set bit and may lead to incorrect results or an infinite loop.

Evaluation:
{
  "validation_passed": true,
  "pass_rate": 1.0,

SUCCESS: Simple approach worked! All tests passed.
