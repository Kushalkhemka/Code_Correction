--- PHASE 1: Simple Analysis (Fast Track) ---
Running simple bug finder...
Bug Analysis Result:
{
    "line_number": 10,
    "buggy_line": "    while True:",
    "bug_type": "Logic error (infinite loop / missing empty queue check)",
    "explanation": "The loop uses 'while True:' without checking if the queue is empty. When no path exists from the start node to the goal node (for example, in test3 with two unconnected nodes), the queue will eventually become empty, and calling 'popleft()' on an empty queue will raise an IndexError instead of returning False as expected.",
    "fix_suggestion": "Replace 'while True:' with 'while queue:' so that the loop terminates when there are no more nodes to explore. Additionally, you can remove the unreachable 'return False' after the loop; or alternatively, place it outside the while loop to handle the case when the queue is empty."
}

Running simple bug fixer...
Fix Result:
BUG FIX:
- Original Bug: The code used "while True:" which caused an infinite loop or an IndexError when the queue became empty because there was no check on the queue.
- Fix Applied: Changed the loop condition to "while queue:" so that the loop stops when the queue is empty, and moved "return False" outside the loop to indicate that the goalnode was not reached.
- Reasoning: The revised loop condition ensures that the algorithm terminates correctly when no path exists. This addresses the infinite loop issue and avoids errors from attempting to pop from an empty deque.

Running simple evaluator...
Evaluation:
{
    "validation_passed": true,
    "pass_rate": 1.0,
    "total_tests": 5,
    "passed_tests": 5,
    "summary": "All tests passed successfully."
}


SUCCESS: Simple approach worked! All tests passed.
