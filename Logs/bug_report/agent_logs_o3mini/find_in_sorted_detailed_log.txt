--- PHASE 1: Simple Analysis (Fast Track) ---
Running simple bug finder...
Bug Analysis Result:
{
    "line_number": 9,
    "buggy_line": "return binsearch(mid, end)",
    "bug_type": "Recursion boundary error",
    "explanation": "When x > arr[mid], the recursive call uses the same mid index (i.e., binsearch(mid, end)) instead of excluding it. This may cause an infinite loop or repeatedly check the same element, especially when start+1 equals end. The correct behavior is to start the search from the next index (mid+1).",
    "fix_suggestion": "Change the line to: return binsearch(mid + 1, end)"
}

Running simple bug fixer...
Fix Result:
BUG FIX:
- Original Bug: The recursion call when x > arr[mid] did not exclude the mid index, potentially causing an infinite loop.
- Fix Applied: Modified the recursive call from "return binsearch(mid, end)" to "return binsearch(mid + 1, end)".
- Reasoning: By excluding the mid index, we ensure that the search space is reduced and avoid revisiting the same element, thereby preventing infinite recursion and correctly performing the binary search.

Running simple evaluator...
Evaluation:
{
  "validation_passed": true,
  "pass_rate": 1.0,
  "total_tests": 7,
  "passed_tests": 7,
  "summary": "All tests passed successfully."
}


SUCCESS: Simple approach worked! All tests passed.
