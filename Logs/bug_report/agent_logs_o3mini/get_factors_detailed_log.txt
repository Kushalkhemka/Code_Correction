--- PHASE 1: Simple Analysis (Fast Track) ---
Running simple bug finder...
Bug Analysis Result:
{
    "line_number": 9,
    "buggy_line": "    return []",
    "bug_type": "incorrect return value for prime numbers",
    "explanation": "When n is prime (such as 101), the loop never finds a factor and the function incorrectly returns an empty list. Instead, it should return [n] as per the expected prime factorization output.",
    "fix_suggestion": "Replace the final 'return []' with 'return [n]' so that the function returns the prime number itself when no factors are found."
}

Running simple bug fixer...
Fix Result:
BUG FIX:
- Original Bug: The function incorrectly returns an empty list for prime numbers.
- Fix Applied: Replaced the final "return []" with "return [n]".
- Reasoning: This change ensures that when no factors are found in the loop, indicating that n is prime, the function returns [n] in line with the expected behavior for prime factorization.

Running simple evaluator...
Evaluation:
{
    "validation_passed": true,
    "pass_rate": 1.0,
    "total_tests": 11,
    "passed_tests": 11,
    "summary": "All tests passed successfully for the fixed version of 'get_factors'."
}


SUCCESS: Simple approach worked! All tests passed.
