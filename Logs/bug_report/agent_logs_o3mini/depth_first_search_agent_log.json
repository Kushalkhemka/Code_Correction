This means that even after visiting a node, the algorithm may visit it again, leading to infinite recursion or a RecursionError when cycles are present (as in test case 5).\",\n    \"fix_suggestion\": \"Before recursing into the successors, add a line to mark the current node as visited. For example:\\n\\n    def search_from(node):\\n        if node in nodesvisited:\\n            return False\\n        nodesvisited.add(node)  # <-- Add this line\\n        if node is goalnode:\\n            return True\\n        else:\\n            return any(search_from(nextnode) for nextnode in node.successors)\\n\\nThis change will correctly track visited nodes and prevent revisiting nodes in cycles.\"\n}",
    "bug_fixer_output": "BUG FIX:\n- Original Bug: The DFS function did not mark nodes as visited before recursing, which could lead to infinite loops or recursion errors in the presence of cycles.\n- Fix Applied: Added a line (nodesvisited.add(node)) before recursing into the successors to track visited nodes.\n- Reasoning: By marking a node as visited the moment it is first encountered, we prevent re-exploring it. This change ensures that the algorithm does not revisit nodes in a cycle, avoiding infinite recursion and potential recursion errors when cycles are present.",
