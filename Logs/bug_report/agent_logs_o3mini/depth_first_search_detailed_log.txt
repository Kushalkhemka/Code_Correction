Bug Analysis Result:
{
    "line_number": "Line 10 (just before recursing through successors)",
    "buggy_line": "return any(\n                search_from(nextnode) for nextnode in node.successors\n            )",
    "bug_type": "logical error (missing visited node tracking)",
    "explanation": "The function checks whether a node was visited to prevent infinite loops in cyclic graphs, but it never adds nodes to the 'nodesvisited' set. This means that even after visiting a node, the algorithm may visit it again, leading to infinite recursion or a RecursionError when cycles are present (as in test case 5).",
    "fix_suggestion": "Before recursing into the successors, add a line to mark the current node as visited. For example:\n\n    def search_from(node):\n        if node in nodesvisited:\n            return False\n        nodesvisited.add(node)  # <-- Add this line\n        if node is goalnode:\n            return True\n        else:\n            return any(search_from(nextnode) for nextnode in node.successors)\n\nThis change will correctly track visited nodes and prevent revisiting nodes in cycles."

Running simple bug fixer...
Fix Result:
BUG FIX:
- Original Bug: The DFS function did not mark nodes as visited before recursing, which could lead to infinite loops or recursion errors in the presence of cycles.
- Fix Applied: Added a line (nodesvisited.add(node)) before recursing into the successors to track visited nodes.
- Reasoning: By marking a node as visited the moment it is first encountered, we prevent re-exploring it. This change ensures that the algorithm does not revisit nodes in a cycle, avoiding infinite recursion and potential recursion errors when cycles are present.

Running simple evaluator...
Evaluation:
{
  "validation_passed": true,
  "pass_rate": 1.0,
  "total_tests": 5,
  "passed_tests": 5,
  "summary": "All tests passed successfully for the fixed 'depth_first_search' code."

SUCCESS: Simple approach worked! All tests passed.
