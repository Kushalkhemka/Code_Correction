--- PHASE 1: Simple Analysis (Fast Track) ---
Running simple bug finder...
Bug Analysis Result:
{
  "line_number": 7,
  "buggy_line": "for i, count in enumerate(arr):",
  "bug_type": "incorrect variable used",
  "explanation": "The loop is iterating over 'arr' instead of 'counts'. This means that instead of extending the sorted array based on the count of each integer, it incorrectly uses the values from the original array 'arr'. This leads to incorrect behavior because the algorithm should enumerate over the count of occurrences for each possible integer value in the range [0, k).",
  "fix_suggestion": "Change the loop to iterate over the 'counts' list. Replace the line with: 'for i, count in enumerate(counts):'"
}

Running simple bug fixer...
Fix Result:
BUG FIX:
- Original Bug: The loop was iterating over "arr" instead of "counts" on line 7.
- Fix Applied: Changed the loop to iterate over "counts" using "for i, count in enumerate(counts):".
- Reasoning: Iterating over the "counts" list ensures that we extend the sorted array based on the count of each integer value, which correctly implements the bucket sort algorithm.

Running simple evaluator...
Evaluation:
{
  "validation_passed": true,
  "pass_rate": 1.0,
  "total_tests": 7,
  "passed_tests": 7,
  "summary": "All tests for 'bucketsort' passed successfully."
}


SUCCESS: Simple approach worked! All tests passed.
