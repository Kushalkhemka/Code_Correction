--- PHASE 1: Simple Analysis (Fast Track) ---
Running simple bug finder...
Bug Analysis Result:
{
    "line_number": 11,
    "buggy_line": "return True",
    "bug_type": "logic error",
    "explanation": "The function only checks if the depth ever goes negative, which catches cases where there are extra closing parentheses. However, it fails to verify that the number of opening parentheses matches the number of closing ones. If there are extra opening parentheses (i.e., depth > 0) at the end, the function incorrectly returns True.",
    "fix_suggestion": "Change the final return statement to return whether depth is 0. For example, replace line 11 with: 'return depth == 0'."
}

Running simple bug fixer...
Fix Result:
BUG FIX:
- Original Bug: The function always returns True at the end, even when there are unmatched opening parentheses.
- Fix Applied: Changed the final return statement to "return depth == 0" to ensure that all opening parentheses are properly closed.
- Reasoning: This fix checks whether the cumulative depth of parentheses returns to 0 after processing the string, which correctly verifies if the number of opening and closing parentheses match.

Running simple evaluator...
Evaluation:
{
    "validation_passed": true,
    "pass_rate": 1.0,
    "total_tests": 3,
    "passed_tests": 3,
    "summary": "All tests passed for the fixed version of is_valid_parenthesization."
}


SUCCESS: Simple approach worked! All tests passed.
