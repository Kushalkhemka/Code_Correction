  "bug_type": "Incorrect operator",
  "explanation": "The classic popcount trick clears the lowest set bit by doing n &= n - 1. Using XOR (n ^= n - 1) does not clear that bit and leads to wrong results or an infinite loop.",
  "fix_suggestion": "Replace the XOR assignment with AND assignment: `n &= n - 1`."
