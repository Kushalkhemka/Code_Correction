{"line_number":10,"buggy_line":"while True:","bug_type":"Incorrect loop condition leading to infinite loop or crash","explanation":"Using `while True:` means the loop never terminates normally. If the goal node isn’t reachable, `queue.popleft()` will eventually be called on an empty queue, raising an `IndexError` and never reaching the `return False`.","fix_suggestion":"Change the loop to `while queue:` so it only iterates while there are nodes left. When the queue is empty, the loop will exit and the function will correctly return False."}
