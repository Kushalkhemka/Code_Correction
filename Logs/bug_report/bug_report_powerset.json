  "explanation": "This line only returns the subsets that include the first element of `arr`, omitting all the subsets that exclude it. A power set must include both.",
  "fix_suggestion": "Change the return to:\n  return rest_subsets + [[first] + subset for subset in rest_subsets]\nso that you combine the subsets without `first` and those with `first`."
