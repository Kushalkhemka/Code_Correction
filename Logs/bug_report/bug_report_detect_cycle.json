{"line_number":5,"buggy_line":"if hare.successor is None:","bug_type":"Missing null check","explanation":"The code checks only whether hare.successor is None but never verifies that hare itself isn’t None before trying to access its successor. In cases where hare has moved two steps past the end of the list, hare becomes None and the next iteration raises an AttributeError.","fix_suggestion":"Change the check to `if hare is None or hare.successor is None: return False`, or rewrite the loop as `while hare and hare.successor: ... return False` after the loop."}
