{"line_number": 3, "buggy_line": "while abs(x - approx) > epsilon:", "bug_type": "Logical error", "explanation": "The loop is checking the absolute difference between x and the current approximation, rather than between x and the square of the approximation. Newton's method converges on sqrt(x) by reducing |approx**2 - x|, so the wrong condition prevents correct convergence (or may never terminate).", "fix_suggestion": "Change the loop condition to compare x with approx**2, e.g.:\n    while abs(approx * approx - x) > epsilon:"}
