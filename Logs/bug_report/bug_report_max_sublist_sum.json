Here’s the bug report:

```json
{
  "line_number": 5,
  "buggy_line": "        max_ending_here = max_ending_here + x",
  "bug_type": "logic error",
  "explanation": "Kadane’s algorithm requires you to reset the running sum to 0 (or to x if you disallow empty subarrays) whenever it falls below 0. By simply adding x to max_ending_here, you carry a negative subtotal forward and miss potentially higher sums in subsequent positive runs. In the example [4, -5, 2, 1, -1, 3] this causes you to compute only 4 instead of the correct 5.",
  "fix_suggestion": "Change that line to reset on negatives. For allowing empty subarrays use:\n    max_ending_here = max(0, max_ending_here + x)\nOr if you require non-empty subarrays use:\n    max_ending_here = max(x, max_ending_here + x)"
}
