 "bug_type": "Logic error",  
 "explanation": "When moving the largest disk of the current recursive frame, it’s being sent to the helper peg instead of the intended end peg. For a single disk (height=1), this causes the disk to move to the wrong peg.",  
 "fix_suggestion": "Change that line to steps.append((start, end)) so that the bottom disk moves from start directly to end."}
