{"line_number": 1, "buggy_line": "from .shortest_paths import shortest_paths", "bug_type": "ImportError (invalid relative import)", "explanation": "This uses a leading-dot relative import which only works inside a properly installed package. If you try to run this script directly (as __main__), Python will complain that there is no parent package for the relative import.", "fix_suggestion": "Change it to an absolute import, for example:\n    from shortest_paths import shortest_paths\nor run the test as a module of the containing package (python -m package_name.shortest_paths_test) so that the relative import is valid."}
