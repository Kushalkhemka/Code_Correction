This omission can lead to an infinite loop if the graph contains cycles because the same node can be revisited indefinitely.\n   - The `nodesvisited` set is intended to track visited nodes to avoid cycles, but the code fails to update it when a node is first encountered.\n\n5. **Fix Suggestion**: \n   - Add the line `nodesvisited.add(node)` immediately after the `if` check to ensure the node is marked as visited before exploring its successors.\n\n### JSON Output:\n```json\n{\n    \"line_number\": 4,\n    \"buggy_line\": \"if node in nodesvisited:\",\n    \"bug_type\": \"Missing line\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The code does not add the current node to the 'nodesvisited' set, which can lead to infinite loops in cyclic graphs because nodes are not marked as visited.\",\n    \"fix_suggestion\": \"Add 'nodesvisited.add(node)' after the 'if' check to mark the node as visited before exploring its successors.\"\n}\n```",
  "fix_result": "BUG FIX COMPLETE (DeepSeek):\n- Bug Classification: Missing line\n- Original Bug: The code did not add the current node to the `nodesvisited` set, which could lead to infinite loops in cyclic graphs because nodes were not marked as visited.\n- Fix Applied: Added `nodesvisited.add(node)` after the `if` check to mark the node as visited before exploring its successors.\n- Reasoning: This ensures that each node is marked as visited as soon as it is encountered, preventing infinite loops in cyclic graphs and ensuring the algorithm terminates correctly. \n\nThe fixed code has been written to the file with the proper classification header.",
