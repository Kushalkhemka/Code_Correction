The formula for updating the shortest path between nodes `i` and `j` via an intermediate node `k` should be:  \n   ```python\n   length_by_path[i, j] = min(\n       length_by_path[i, j],\n       length_by_path[i, k] + length_by_path[k, j]\n   )\n   ```  \n   The current implementation incorrectly uses `length_by_path[j, k]` instead of `length_by_path[k, j]`. This is problematic because it violates the Floyd-Warshall algorithm's logic, which relies on the correct intermediate node (`k`) to update the path from `i` to `j`. Using `j, k` instead of `k, j` leads to incorrect path calculations.\n\n5. **Fix Suggestion**:  \n   Replace `length_by_path[j, k]` with `length_by_path[k, j]` to correctly implement the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.\n\n### JSON Output:\n```json\n{\n    \"line_number\": 9,\n    \"buggy_line\": \"length_by_path[i, j] = min(\\n    length_by_path[i, j],\\n    length_by_path[i, k] + length_by_path[j, k]\\n)\",\n    \"bug_type\": \"Incorrect variable\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The formula for updating the shortest path between nodes `i` and `j` via an intermediate node `k` is incorrect.

  "fix_result": "BUG FIX COMPLETE (DeepSeek):\n- Bug Classification: Incorrect variable\n- Original Bug: The formula for updating the shortest path between nodes `i` and `j` via an intermediate node `k` incorrectly used `length_by_path[j, k]` instead of `length_by_path[k, j]`.\n- Fix Applied: Replaced `length_by_path[j, k]` with `length_by_path[k, j]` to correctly implement the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.\n- Reasoning: The Floyd-Warshall algorithm relies on the correct intermediate node (`k`) to update the path from `i` to `j`. Using `j, k` instead of `k, j` violates the algorithm's logic and leads to incorrect path calculations. The fix ensures the correct path update formula is applied.\n\nThe fixed code has been written to the file with the proper classification header.",
