However, the arithmetic expression `(len(digit_list)) * [0]` is incorrect because it multiplies the integer `len(digit_list)` by the list `[0]`, which is not syntactically valid. The correct approach is to multiply the list `[0]` by the length of `digit_list` to create a list of zeros of the required length.\",\n    \"fix_suggestion\": \"Replace the line with `return [1] + [0] * len(digit_list) + [1]` to correctly create a list of zeros of the required length.\"\n}\n```",
  "fix_result": "BUG FIX COMPLETE (DeepSeek):\n- Bug Classification: Incorrect arithmetic expression\n- Original Bug: The buggy line attempted to construct a list of zeros by multiplying an integer with a list, which is syntactically incorrect.\n- Fix Applied: Replaced the line with `return [1] + [0] * len(digit_list) + [1]` to correctly create a list of zeros of the required length.\n- Reasoning: The original code incorrectly multiplied an integer (`len(digit_list)`) by the list `[0]`, which is not valid syntax. The fix ensures the list `[0]` is multiplied by the length of `digit_list` to create the correct list of zeros.\n\nThe fixed code has been written to the file with the proper classification header.",
