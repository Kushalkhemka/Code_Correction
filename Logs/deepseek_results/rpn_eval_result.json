This leads to incorrect results for these operations. For example, `5 - 3` would incorrectly compute as `3 - 5`.\n5. **Fix Suggestion**: \n   - Swap the order of popping values from the stack. Pop `b` first and then `a` to ensure the correct order of operands.\n\n### JSON Output:\n```json\n{\n    \"line_number\": 10,\n    \"buggy_line\": \"a = stack.pop()\",\n    \"bug_type\": \"Variable swap\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The bug occurs because the operands are popped in the wrong order for operations like subtraction and division.

  "fix_result": "BUG FIX COMPLETE (DeepSeek):\n- Bug Classification: Variable swap\n- Original Bug: The operands were popped in the wrong order for operations like subtraction and division, leading to incorrect results.\n- Fix Applied: Swapped the order of popping values from the stack: `b = stack.pop()` followed by `a = stack.pop()`.\n- Reasoning: In Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), the first operand popped should be the second operand in the operation, and the second popped should be the first operand. The fix ensures the correct order of operands for all operations, resolving the issue.\n\nThe fixed code has been written to the file with the proper classification header.",
