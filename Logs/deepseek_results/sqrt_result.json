  "bug_analysis": "Here is the analysis of the provided Python code for the `sqrt` function:\n\n### Bug Analysis:\n1. **Line Number**: 2  \n2. **Buggy Line**: `approx = x / 2`  \n3. **Bug Type**: Missing condition  \n4. **Explanation**:  \n   - The function assumes `x >= 1` as per the precondition, but it does not handle the case where `x` is 0 or negative.  \n   - If `x` is 0, the initial approximation `approx = x / 2` will be 0, and the division `x / approx` in the loop will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`.  \n   - If `x` is negative, the function will enter an infinite loop or produce incorrect results because the Newton-Raphson method is not valid for negative numbers (unless working with complex numbers, which is not the case here).  \n   - This is a \"Missing condition\" bug because the function lacks a check for invalid inputs (e.g., `x <= 0`).  \n\n5. **Fix Suggestion**:  \n   - Add a condition at the beginning of the function to handle invalid inputs (e.g., `x <= 0`). For example:  \n     ```python\n     if x <= 0:\n         raise ValueError(\"x must be a positive number\")\n     ```\n\n### JSON Output:\n```json\n{\n    \"line_number\": 2,\n    \"buggy_line\": \"approx = x / 2\",\n    \"bug_type\": \"Missing condition\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The function assumes x >= 1 but does not handle cases where x is 0 or negative.

  "fix_result": "BUG FIX COMPLETE (DeepSeek):\n- Bug Classification: Missing condition\n- Original Bug: The function assumed `x >= 1` but did not handle cases where `x` is 0 or negative, leading to potential `ZeroDivisionError` or incorrect results.\n- Fix Applied: Added a condition at the beginning of the function to check for invalid inputs (`x <= 0`) and raise a `ValueError` if encountered.\n- Reasoning: The Newton-Raphson method is not valid for non-positive numbers, and the function must explicitly handle such cases to avoid runtime errors or infinite loops.\n\nThe fixed code has been written to the file with the proper classification header.",
