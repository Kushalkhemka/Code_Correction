Here's the analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"line_number\": 5,\n    \"buggy_line\": \"steps.append((start, helper))\",\n    \"bug_type\": \"Variable swap\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The bug occurs in the line where the disk is moved from the `start` peg to the `helper` peg. According to the Towers of Hanoi rules, the disk should be moved from the `start` peg to the `end` peg, not the `helper` peg. The `helper` peg is only used for intermediate steps, and the final move should involve the `end` peg.\",\n    \"fix_suggestion\": \"Replace `steps.append((start, helper))` with `steps.append((start, end))` to correctly move the disk from the `start` peg to the `end` peg.\"\n}\n```",
  "fix_result": "BUG FIX COMPLETE (DeepSeek):\n- Bug Classification: Variable swap\n- Original Bug: The bug occurred in the line where the disk was moved from the `start` peg to the `helper` peg instead of the `end` peg, violating the Towers of Hanoi rules.\n- Fix Applied: Replaced `steps.append((start, helper))` with `steps.append((start, end))` to correctly move the disk from the `start` peg to the `end` peg.\n- Reasoning: The `helper` peg is only meant for intermediate steps, and the final move must involve the `end` peg to adhere to the puzzle's rules. The fix ensures the correct sequence of moves. \n\nThe fixed code has been written to the file with the proper classification header.",
