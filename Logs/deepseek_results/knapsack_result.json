The current condition excludes the case where the item's weight exactly matches the remaining capacity (`j`), which could lead to suboptimal solutions.  \n5. **Fix Suggestion**:  \n   Replace the condition with `if weight <= j:` to correctly include cases where the item's weight matches the remaining capacity.\n\n### JSON Output:\n```json\n{\n    \"line_number\": 8,\n    \"buggy_line\": \"if weight < j:\",\n    \"bug_type\": \"Incorrect comparison operator\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The condition should check if the item's weight is less than or equal to the current capacity (j).

  "fix_result": "BUG FIX COMPLETE (DeepSeek):\n- Bug Classification: Incorrect comparison operator\n- Original Bug: The condition `if weight < j:` was incorrect; it excluded cases where the item's weight exactly matched the remaining capacity.\n- Fix Applied: Replaced the condition with `if weight <= j:` to correctly include cases where the item's weight matches the remaining capacity.\n- Reasoning: The original condition could lead to suboptimal solutions by excluding valid cases where the item's weight equals the remaining capacity. The fix ensures all valid cases are considered, improving the accuracy of the knapsack solution.\n\nThe fixed code has been written to the file with proper classification header.",
