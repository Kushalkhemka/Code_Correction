Instead, it counts the number of times the rightmost 1-bit is cleared.\n   - The correct operation to count 1-bits is to use the bitwise AND operation (`&`) with `n - 1` to clear the rightmost 1-bit in each iteration.\n4. **Fix Suggestion**: Replace `n ^= n - 1` with `n &= n - 1`. This will correctly clear the rightmost 1-bit in each iteration and increment the count.\n\n### JSON Output:\n```json\n{\n    \"line_number\": 3,\n    \"buggy_line\": \"n ^= n - 1\",\n    \"bug_type\": \"Incorrect method called\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The XOR operation (`^=`) is incorrectly used here to count 1-bits.
