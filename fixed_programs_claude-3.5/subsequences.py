# Fixed Program: subsequences (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)
# Bug Classification: Incorrect array slice
# Bug Description: The range calculation in the for loop used incorrect bounds (b + 1 - k) which prematurely cut off valid subsequences by not including all possible starting positions for k-length sequences.

Subsequences

 
Input:
    a: An int
    b: An int
    k: A positive int

Output:
    A list of all length-k ascending sequences of ints in range(a, b)

Example:
    >>> subsequences(a=1, b=5, k=3)
    [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 4], [1, 3, 4], [2, 3, 4]]
