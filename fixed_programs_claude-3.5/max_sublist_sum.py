# Fixed Program: max_sublist_sum (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)
# Bug Classification: Missing condition
# Bug Description: The algorithm fails to handle negative numbers correctly because it doesn't reset max_ending_here to 0 when it becomes negative. This causes it to unnecessarily carry forward negative sums, potentially missing the maximum subarray sum that starts after a negative sequence.

Max Sublist Sum
max-sublist-sum

Efficient equivalent to max(sum(arr[i:j]) for 0 <= i <= j <= len(arr))

Algorithm source: WordAligned.org by Thomas Guest


Input:
    arr: A list of ints

Output:
    The maximum sublist sum

Example:
    >>> max_sublist_sum([4, -5, 2, 1, -1, 3])
    5
