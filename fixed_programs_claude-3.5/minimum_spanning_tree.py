# Fixed Program: minimum_spanning_tree (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)
# Bug Classification: Incorrect method called
# Bug Description: The implementation used update() method which only modified sets in place, leading to inconsistent component tracking in Kruskal's algorithm since not all nodes in both components were pointing to the same set object.

"""
Minimum Spanning Tree


Kruskal's algorithm implementation.

Input:
    weight_by_edge: A dict of the form {(u, v): weight} for every undirected graph edge {u, v}

Precondition:
    The input graph is connected

Output:
    A set of edges that connects all the vertices of the input graph and has the least possible total weight.

Example:
    >>> minimum_spanning_tree({
    ...     (1, 2): 10,
    ...     (2, 3): 15,
    ...     (3, 4): 10,
    ...     (1, 4): 10
    ... })
    {(1, 2), (3, 4), (1, 4)}
