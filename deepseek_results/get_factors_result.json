The current implementation checks divisors up to `int(n ** 0.5)`, but it should check up to `int(n ** 0.5) + 1` to ensure that the square root of `n` is included in the range. Without the `+1`, the loop might miss a prime factor if `n` is a perfect square.\",\n    \"fix_suggestion\": \"Change the line to `for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):` to include the upper bound in the range.\"\n}\n```",
  "fix_result": "BUG FIX COMPLETE (DeepSeek):\n- Bug Classification: Missing +1\n- Original Bug: The loop range was missing `+1`, which could cause the loop to miss a prime factor if `n` is a perfect square.\n- Fix Applied: Added `+1` to the loop range to ensure the upper bound is included.\n- Reasoning: Including `+1` ensures that the square root of `n` is checked, which is necessary for correctly identifying all prime factors, especially when `n` is a perfect square.\n\nThe fixed code has been written to the file with the proper classification header.",
