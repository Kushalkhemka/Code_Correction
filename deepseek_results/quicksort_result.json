  "bug_analysis": "The provided code implements the quicksort algorithm with improvements for handling duplicates and efficient pivot selection. After analyzing the code, I found a bug in the pivot selection logic when the array length is 2 or less. Here's the analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"line_number\": 14,\n    \"buggy_line\": \"pivot, pivot_index = arr[0], 0\",\n    \"bug_type\": \"Incorrect variable\",\n    \"explanation\": \"When the array length is 2 or less, the code defaults to selecting the first element as the pivot and its index as 0. However, this does not account for the case where the array has exactly 2 elements. The pivot selection should still use the median-of-three logic for arrays of length 2 to ensure better performance and avoid worst-case scenarios.\",\n    \"fix_suggestion\": \"Modify the condition to include arrays of length 2 in the median-of-three pivot selection. Replace the line with: `if len(arr) >= 2:` and adjust the logic accordingly.\"\n}\n```",
  "fix_result": "BUG FIX COMPLETE (DeepSeek):\n- Bug Classification: Incorrect variable\n- Original Bug: The pivot selection logic incorrectly defaulted to the first element for arrays of length 2, missing the opportunity to use the median-of-three method for better performance.\n- Fix Applied: Modified the condition to include arrays of length 2 in the median-of-three pivot selection by changing the condition from `if len(arr) > 2:` to `if len(arr) >= 2:`.\n- Reasoning: The median-of-three pivot selection method ensures better performance and avoids worst-case scenarios. By including arrays of length 2 in this logic, the algorithm maintains its efficiency even for small arrays. The fix ensures consistent pivot selection behavior across all array sizes greater than or equal to 2.",
