# Fixed Program: kth (DeepSeek)
# Bug Classification: Missing arithmetic expression
# Bug Description: The variable `num_lessoreq` was incorrectly calculated as `len(arr) - len(above)`, which does not account for elements equal to the pivot. The correct calculation should be `num_lessoreq = num_less + 1` to include the pivot itself in the count.

QuickSelect

This is an efficient equivalent to sorted(arr)[k].

Input:
    arr: A list of ints
    k: An int

Precondition:
    0 <= k < len(arr)

Output:
    The kth-lowest element of arr (0-based)
