# Fixed Program: longest_common_subsequence (DeepSeek)
# Bug Classification: Missing line
# Bug Description: The bug occurs when the first characters of `a` and `b` match. The current implementation only recurses on `a[1:]` and `b`, missing potential longer subsequences that might start with the same character but skip some characters in `b`. The fix involves adding the missing recursive call to `longest_common_subsequence(a, b[1:])` in the `elif` block to ensure all possible subsequences are considered.

Longest Common Subsequence


Calculates the longest subsequence common to the two input strings. (A subsequence is any sequence of letters in the same order
they appear in the string, possibly skipping letters in between.)

Input:
    a: The first string to consider.
    b: The second string to consider.

Output:
    The longest string which is a subsequence of both strings. (If multiple subsequences of equal length exist, either is OK.)

Example:
    >>> longest_common_subsequence('headache', 'pentadactyl')
    'eadac'
