It also does not handle the case where the remaining text is less than the column width but still needs to be added to the output. This means the last segment of text can be missed if it doesn't meet the conditions imposed by the while loop.\",\n    \"fix_suggestion\": \"Add a final check to append any remaining text after the while loop. Add the following line at the end of the function: 'if text: lines.append(text)'\"\n}\n```",
  "fix_result": "BUG FIX COMPLETE:\n- **Bug Classification:** Missing condition\n- **Original Bug:** The function did not check if any text remains to wrap after processing, potentially missing the last segment.\n- **Fix Applied:** Added a final check to append any remaining text after the while loop: `if text: lines.append(text)`.\n- **Reasoning:** This change ensures that any text left after the while processing is correctly added to the output list, thereby preventing loss of data.\n\nThe fixed code has been saved accordingly.",
