However, it does not ensure that 'nextnode' itself has a valid state as it does not account for cases where 'nextnode' should not be processed further if it has dependencies that are not yet satisfied. Without a condition to filter based on the dependencies of 'nextnode', this could lead to incorrect ordering.\",\"fix_suggestion\":\"Add a check to ensure 'nextnode' has all its required incoming nodes in 'ordered_nodes' before appending it. For example, you might want to check if all of 'nextnode.incoming_nodes' are in 'ordered_nodes'.\"}",
  "fix_result": "BUG FIX COMPLETE:\n- **Bug Classification:** Missing condition\n- **Original Bug:** The code did not ensure that 'nextnode' itself had all its required incoming nodes in 'ordered_nodes' before processing it.\n- **Fix Applied:** Added a check to ensure all incoming nodes of 'nextnode' are in 'ordered_nodes' before appending it to the list.\n- **Reasoning:** This ensures that 'nextnode' is only processed if all of its dependencies are satisfied, which prevents incorrect ordering in the final topological sort.\n\nThe fixed code has been written to the file with the proper classification header.",
